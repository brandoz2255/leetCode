#### Key things to consider from this challenge

### 1. **String Manipulation:**

- **Character Conversion:** I used the character manipulation function `tolower(c)` to handle *case insensitivity*, which is crucial when working with *user inputs* or *datasets* that might not be uniform in case.
- **Position Calculation:** The conversion of characters to their respective positions in the alphabet using `c - 'a' + 1` is a common technique.
	- This logic can be useful in any situation where you need to map characters to numerical values.

- **for loops**: `for` loops effectively for iteration, both for looping through characters in a string and for performing transformations.
